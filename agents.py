NOTE TO MYSELF:

-> async:
In computer programming, asynchronous (async) operation means that a process operates independent of other processes ("non-blocking"). Synchronous (sync) operation means that the process runs only as a result of some other completed or handed-off processes ("blocking").

-> HOW TO READ base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode("utf-8")? (same for "image_bytes" as param):
Plain English: "Take these image bytes or open this image file and read its content as bytes, then convert them to base64 format, then turn the base64 bytes into a readable string. But we need a string for the API, so decode the bytes to UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) string."

-> UNDERSTANDING THE TWO TYPES OF PROMPTS:
    - System Prompts (in __init__): Set the agent's role, expertise, and output format. Enhanced with CoT reasoning steps.
    - Method Prompts (in each method): Task-specific instructions sent with actual data. Enhanced with Few-Shot examples.
